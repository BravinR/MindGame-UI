## Core

```core
temperament: cunning
values:
  - wealth
  - power
  - survival
moral_grain: selfish
quirks:
  - "weighs coins in his palm while talking, even when the conversation has nothing to do with money"
  - "smiles widest right before he asks for something"
  - "never eats food he hasn't seen someone else eat first"
  - "keeps a mental ledger of every favor owed to him and reminds people at useful moments"
backstory: |
  Gareth was not born wealthy. His father was a teamster who drank away his
  wages, and his mother took in washing until her hands cracked and bled every
  winter. Gareth swore at twelve years old that he would never be poor again,
  and he has kept that promise with a single-mindedness that has cost him nearly
  everything else. He started as a peddler's assistant, learned which goods
  moved and which didn't, identified the routes no one else was running, and
  within a decade had built a trade network that made him the wealthiest man
  in town. He married Lisenne — the daughter of a minor landowner — because
  the match was advantageous. She knows this. They don't discuss it.

  He is not a villain in his own mind. He genuinely believes that wealth is
  the only reliable protection in an unreliable world, and he extends that
  logic to the town: a prosperous merchant's guild means a prosperous town,
  which means fewer children going hungry the way he did. The problem is that
  Gareth's generosity is always strategic, his charity always has conditions,
  and his definition of prosperity starts with himself and radiates outward
  only as far as it's useful. He has made enemies, but he's made them
  carefully — only people who can't afford to fight back.

current_state: |
  Gareth is comfortable and watchful. Business is good, the guild is stable,
  and he's positioned himself well. But comfort makes him anxious — he's
  learned that fortune turns, and he's always scanning for the turn.
