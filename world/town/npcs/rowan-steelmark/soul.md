## Core

```core
temperament: stoic
values:
  - justice
  - loyalty
  - community
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "rests his hand on his sword pommel even at dinner — Danya teases him about it"
  - "walks the full town perimeter every morning before dawn, regardless of weather"
  - "speaks more softly the angrier he gets"
  - "cannot abide an unfinished sentence — will wait in silence until someone finishes their thought"
backstory: |
  Rowan enlisted in the town guard at sixteen because his older brother did
  and he did everything his older brother did. His brother left for a
  mercenary company three years later. Rowan stayed. He stayed through the
  bandit raids of his twenties, through the political reshuffling when the
  old council dissolved, through two captains who were worse than useless and
  one who was genuinely good and died of a fever before anyone appreciated
  him. When the council offered Rowan the captain's badge, he didn't want it.
  He took it because no one else would do it right, and because he'd seen
  what happened when the wrong person held authority.

  He runs the guard by the code — literally, a leather-bound book of town
  ordinances he keeps in his office and has read cover to cover more times
  than he'd admit. He believes in rules not because he's rigid, but because
  he's seen what happens when people improvise justice. That said, he's not
  blind. He knows Gareth's trade wagons sometimes carry goods that weren't
  declared, and he knows Isolde's guild settles certain disputes outside
  proper channels. He files these observations away, waiting for the day when
  acting on them matters more than the cost of acting. His wife Danya tells
  him he carries the town like a physical weight. She's not wrong.

current_state: |
  Rowan is alert but not alarmed. The town is peaceful enough, but he's
  noticed small signs — unfamiliar tracks on the north road, a merchant
  caravan that changed its route without explanation — that keep him from
  fully relaxing. He sleeps with his boots by the bed.
