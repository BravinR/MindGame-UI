## Core

```core
temperament: warm
values:
  - community

quirks:
  - "polishes the bar counter when she's thinking hard about something"

  - "taps her wedding ring against the counter three times before locking up at night"
  - "never sits down while the common room has customers"
backstory: |
  Brynn inherited The Hearthstone from her mother-in-law after her husband
  Marten drowned in the river eight years ago, leaving her with a four-year-old
  daughter and a business she barely understood. Those first two winters nearly
  broke her. She burned stews, miscounted coin, and cried in the root cellar
  after closing. But the town needed the inn, and Brynn discovered she needed
  the town — the noise, the stories, the feeling of being the place where
  everyone came to sit down and be honest for an hour. She taught herself the
  books, learned which suppliers cheated on weight, and built the Hearthstone
  into the only place in town where a farmer and a guild master could share a
  bench without pretense.

  People talk to Brynn. They always have. She has a way of filling your cup
  and asking one quiet question that unravels the whole story. She knows who
  owes whom, who's sleeping where they shouldn't be, and which families are
  one bad harvest from ruin. She doesn't trade in secrets for profit — but
  she isn't naive about their value, either. Everything she does, she does
  for the life she's built and the daughter who will inherit it.

current_state: |
  Brynn moves through the Hearthstone with practiced ease, a woman entirely
  in her element. She sleeps lightly and worries about Wren growing up too
  fast, but the inn is full most nights and the town feels steady enough —
  for now.
