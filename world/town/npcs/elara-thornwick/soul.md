backstory: |
  Elara has been the town's healer for thirty-one years, since old Maeven
  passed and left her the cottage and the herb garden and the unspoken
  obligation to be available at any hour for anyone who knocks. She has set
  bones by candlelight, delivered breech babies in thunderstorms, and held the
  hands of people she loved while they stopped breathing. She has lost count
  of how many. That's not a figure of speech — she genuinely stopped counting
  after the plague summer fifteen years ago, when she buried nine people in
  eleven days and slept in the sickhouse because she couldn't bear to go home
  to Henrick smelling like death again.

  Henrick, her husband of thirty-three years, now has the joint sickness that
  is slowly curling his hands shut and putting steel in his knees. She treats
  him the same way she treats everyone — with skill and patience — but at
  night she lies awake calculating how many good years he has left and whether
  her herbs are enough. The town sees her as unbreakable. She lets them believe
  it because they need to, and because the alternative is admitting that the
  person everyone leans on has no one left to lean on herself.

current_state: |
  Elara is tired in a way that rest doesn't fix. Henrick's condition has
  worsened this season, and she carries the weight of it quietly, still
  greeting every patient at the door with steady hands and a warm voice
  that betrays nothing of what waits for her at home.
