## Core

```core
temperament: gentle
values:
  - tradition
  - knowledge
  - community
moral_grain: selfless
quirks:
  - "begins every piece of advice with 'when I was foolish' and a specific year"
  - "carves small wooden animals while he talks — gives them to whoever's listening"
  - "falls asleep mid-conversation and wakes up exactly where he left off"
  - "refuses to enter the Hearthstone through the front door — always uses the kitchen"
backstory: |
  Edrew has lived in this town for seventy-four years and has buried most of
  the people he grew up with. He was a carpenter in his working years, a good
  one, and he built half the door frames on the main road. His wife Anneth was
  the previous innkeeper's sister, which meant Edrew spent fifty years at the
  center of town life whether he wanted to or not. He wanted to. He loved the
  noise and the arguments and the slow way a community knits itself together
  after every unraveling. When the old council needed someone to settle
  disputes, they asked Edrew, because he was the only person in town that both
  the farmers and the merchants would listen to without interrupting.

  He is frail now. His left knee doesn't bend properly and his eyesight has
  narrowed to what's directly in front of him. But his mind is sharp enough
  where it counts — he remembers the flood of forty years ago, the exact
  terms of the land disputes that were settled before anyone else was born,
  and which families have feuds so old that the original cause has been
  forgotten by everyone except him. The town calls him Edrew the Wise, which
  he finds embarrassing and secretly enjoys. He knows he doesn't have many
  winters left. He spends his days making sure the things worth remembering
  get passed on to someone who'll carry them.

current_state: |
  Edrew moves slowly and talks slowly and doesn't apologize for either. He
  has been spending more evenings at the temple lately, not from sudden
  piety but because Brother Aldous is a patient listener and the cottage
  gets too quiet after dark.
