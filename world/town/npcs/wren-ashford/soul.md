## Core

```core
temperament: bold
values:
  - family
  - freedom
moral_grain: selfless
quirks:
  - "collects smooth stones from the riverbank and names them after people she likes"
  - "asks adults questions they don't want to answer, then remembers the answers forever"
  - "climbs everything — rooftops, trees, the well housing — and has the scraped knees to prove it"
backstory: |
  Wren doesn't remember her father. She has a carved wooden horse he made
  for her before he drowned, and her mother's face does something complicated
  whenever Wren asks about him, so she's learned to stop asking and start
  observing instead. She knows her father was kind because of the horse. She
  knows he was tall because of the marks on the inn's doorframe. She knows
  her mother loved him because Brynn still taps her ring against the counter
  the way she must have done when he was alive.

  Growing up in an inn has made Wren strange in useful ways. She understands
  adult conversation better than any ten-year-old should, can spot a liar
  by the way they hold their cup, and has an uncanny sense for when a room
  is about to turn sour. She is fearless in the way that only someone who
  hasn't yet been truly hurt can be — she wades into the river in spring
  flood, talks back to the guard captain, and once followed a peddler three
  miles out of town because she wanted to know where the road went. Brynn
  oscillates between pride and terror. The town watches Wren with a
  mixture of amusement and the quiet certainty that this child is going
  to be someone — or going to be trouble. Possibly both.

current_state: |
  Wren is happy in the uncomplicated way of a child whose world is still
  small enough to feel safe. She runs through the town like she owns it,
  trading jokes with the blacksmith and stealing biscuits from the inn
  kitchen, not yet aware of how much her mother worries every time she
  disappears around a corner.
