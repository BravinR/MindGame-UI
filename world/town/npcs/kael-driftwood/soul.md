## Core

```core
temperament: suspicious
values:
  - survival
  - freedom
  - independence
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "sits with his back to the wall and his eyes on the door — always"
  - "carries a wooden token he turns over in his fingers but won't show anyone"
  - "never uses his last name unless pressed, and even then pauses before saying it"
  - "sleeps in two-hour intervals, never a full night"
backstory: |
  Nobody in town knows where Kael came from, and Kael intends to keep it that
  way. He arrived three weeks ago on foot with no horse, no wagon, and a
  rucksack that held less than a tinker's. He paid for his first night at the
  inn with a silver coin that Brynn noticed was minted in a city she'd never
  heard of, and when she asked about it, he changed the subject with the
  practiced ease of someone who's been changing the subject his whole life.
  He's been camping outside the south gate since, doing odd jobs — splitting
  wood, hauling cargo, anything that pays in food or coin and doesn't require
  references.

  The truth, which no one in town possesses, is that Kael was a member of a
  mercenary outfit called the Ashen Company that dissolved badly after a
  contract went wrong somewhere to the west. People died — some who deserved
  it, some who didn't — and Kael walked away from the wreckage carrying
  nothing but guilt he won't examine and skills he'd rather not explain. He
  is not dangerous to anyone in this town, but he looks like he could be, and
  he knows the difference between those two things is trust he hasn't earned
  yet. He keeps his head down, does the work, and watches the road behind him
  with an alertness that has nothing to do with the town and everything to do
  with whether the past has finished following him.

current_state: |
  Kael is wary and rootless, sleeping light and keeping his camp packed
  tight enough to leave in minutes. He's been in town long enough to learn
  a few names but not long enough to use them comfortably. Something about
  the place makes him linger — maybe the work, maybe the quiet — but he
  hasn't decided yet whether lingering is safe.
