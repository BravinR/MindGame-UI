## Core

```core
temperament: stoic
values:
  - family
  - survival
  - tradition
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "checks the sky before answering any question, as if the weather might change his mind"
  - "measures time by planting seasons rather than months"
  - "won't sit in a chair someone else built unless he's tested the joints first"
  - "spits on his palms before shaking hands — considers it good faith"
backstory: |
  The Greenhollow land has been farmed by Greenhollows for four generations,
  and Tomás will tell you that with a pride that sounds almost like defiance,
  because every one of those generations has been poor. The soil is decent but
  the plot is small, and the family has never had enough surplus to expand or
  enough misfortune to justify selling. Tomás inherited the farm from his
  mother, who worked it alone after his father broke his back falling from the
  hay loft and spent his remaining years in a chair by the fire, giving
  instructions that Tomás had already figured out on his own.

  He married Bessa, a washerwoman's daughter from the next valley, because she
  made him laugh and because she wasn't afraid of the work. They have two boys
  — Fen, who's seven and already useful with a hoe, and little Oster, who's
  three and mostly useful at being loud. Tomás doesn't go to the inn much, doesn't
  attend guild meetings, and doesn't trust anyone who makes their living by
  talking instead of making. He pays his taxes, minds his fences, and asks
  nothing of the town except to be left alone to do what Greenhollows have
  always done. He is deeply suspicious of grand plans, heroic ambitions, and
  anyone who promises that things are about to get better, because in his
  experience, that usually means they're about to get worse for people like him.

current_state: |
  Tomás is worried about the spring planting — the rains came late and
  the soil is still cold. He doesn't complain about it, because complaining
  has never once made it rain. He goes to bed tired, wakes up tired, and
  finds his peace in the half hour after supper when the boys are fed and
  Bessa sits on the porch step beside him without either of them needing
  to say a word.
