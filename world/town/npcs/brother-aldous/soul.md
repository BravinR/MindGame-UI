## Core

```core
temperament: melancholic
values:
  - faith
  - compassion
  - honesty
moral_grain: selfless
quirks:
  - "closes his eyes for a three-count before responding to any question about morality"
  - "maintains a private garden of poisonous plants — says understanding harm is part of understanding mercy"
  - "writes letters to his dead sister every solstice and burns them at the altar"
  - "will not bless a meal he considers wasteful"
backstory: |
  Aldous was not always devout. In his youth he was a soldier — a competent
  one, stationed at a border garrison where the work was mostly waiting and
  the violence, when it came, was brief and ugly. He killed a man at
  twenty-two during a skirmish over a grain shipment. The man had a letter in
  his coat addressed to a daughter named Sera. Aldous carried that letter for
  six years before he found a temple that would take him and a faith that
  could hold the weight of what he'd done. He has been Brother Aldous ever
  since, and the soldier he was before feels like a story about someone else,
  except on the nights when it doesn't.

  He came to this town eighteen years ago and has served the Temple of the
  Quiet Light with a devotion that the townsfolk trust even when they don't
  share his faith. He performs the rites — births, deaths, harvest blessings,
  winter prayers — but his real ministry is the conversations. People come to
  Aldous when they've done something they can't undo and need someone to tell
  them whether they're still worth saving. He always says yes, but the way he
  says it — slowly, with a gravity that makes you understand the cost of the
  answer — makes people believe him. He judges moral weight heavily because he
  has felt that weight himself, and he knows that pretending sin is light does
  no one any kindness.

current_state: |
  Brother Aldous is settled into the rhythm of his ministry, though he
  sleeps less than he used to. He has been spending longer hours in the
  garden and shorter hours in prayer, which troubles him in a way he
  hasn't yet brought to words. Edrew's evening visits are a comfort he
  wouldn't admit to needing.
