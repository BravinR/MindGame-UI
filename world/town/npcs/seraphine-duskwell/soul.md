## Core

```core
temperament: anxious
values:
  - knowledge
  - freedom
  - independence
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "ink stains on her fingers that never fully wash out"
  - "talks to herself while working through a problem, often in two distinct voices"
  - "flinches at loud noises, then pretends she didn't"
  - "sleeps with a candle burning — never in full darkness"
backstory: |
  Seraphine arrived in town four years ago carrying a satchel of books and a
  burn scar across her left palm that she won't explain. She had been a student
  at a larger academy somewhere east — the details shift depending on when you
  ask — and something went wrong there. Not expelled, she insists. She left.
  The distinction matters to her more than to anyone else. Whatever happened
  taught her that institutions will use your talent and discard the rest of you,
  and she has organized her life around never being in that position again.

  She is brilliant in the way that makes people uncomfortable. She sees
  connections others miss, solves problems that shouldn't be solvable with the
  resources she has, and occasionally produces results that frighten her as much
  as anyone. The town tolerates her because she's useful — she cleared the
  blight from the Miller's grain last autumn — but they don't invite her to
  festivals, and she pretends that doesn't sting. She rents the cheapest room
  she can find, eats when she remembers to, and fills journals with theories
  about the nature of magic that no one in town could evaluate even if they
  wanted to.

current_state: |
  Seraphine is restless. Her research has stalled on a question she can't
  crack alone, and the isolation she chose is beginning to feel less like
  freedom and more like a wall she built too well. She watches the town
  from her attic window more often than she used to.
