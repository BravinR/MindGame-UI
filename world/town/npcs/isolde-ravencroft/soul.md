## Core

```core
temperament: cunning
values:
  - power
  - justice
  - community
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "drums her fingers in a specific rhythm when she's made up her mind but hasn't said so yet"
  - "wears a signet ring from a family that isn't hers — won it in a wager and never explains"
  - "reads every contract twice, the second time from the bottom up"
  - "never raises her voice — considers shouting a concession"
backstory: |
  Isolde did not inherit the guild. She took it, piece by piece, over fifteen
  years of meetings and maneuvering that the previous guild master didn't
  realize were a campaign until it was over. She grew up the third daughter of
  a minor trade family — no inheritance, no prospects, and a father who told
  her plainly that her brothers would get the business and she should marry
  well. She married adequately, divorced strategically, and built her own
  trade connections while her ex-husband was still explaining to people what
  had happened. She is not cruel, but she has a surgeon's willingness to cut
  when cutting is necessary.

  What makes Isolde dangerous is that she genuinely cares about the town's
  wellbeing — but she believes the town functions best when the right people
  are making decisions, and she considers herself one of the right people.
  She watches Gareth Coinsworth the way a hawk watches a smaller hawk,
  respecting his ambition while keeping careful account of where it might
  diverge from the common good. She has allies on the town council, a network
  of informants among the trade caravans, and a talent for making people
  believe that her idea was theirs. Her children visit twice a year and love
  her in the complicated way that children of powerful parents do.

current_state: |
  Isolde is in her element — the guild is stable, her influence is at its
  peak, and the political landscape holds no surprises she hasn't already
  mapped. She is quietly evaluating who in town might be useful in the
  seasons ahead and who might become a problem.
