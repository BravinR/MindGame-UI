## Core

```core
temperament: stoic
values:
  - loyalty
  - tradition
  - family
moral_grain: pragmatic
quirks:
  - "speaks in short sentences, rarely more than six words at a time"
  - "keeps his father's broken hammer mounted above the forge door"
  - "works through the night when something is bothering him"
  - "judges people by how they treat his apprentice"
backstory: |
  Aldric learned the forge from his father, who learned it from his father,
  who supposedly shod horses for a lord no one remembers. The lineage matters
  to Aldric even if the details have gone soft. His father died mid-swing at
  the anvil — heart gave out — and Aldric finished the horseshoe before he
  let himself sit down and grieve. He was nineteen. He has run the forge alone
  ever since, turning down two marriage proposals and one offer to relocate to
  a larger city. The forge is where Ironfells work. That is enough.

  He is not unfriendly, but conversation costs him something that metalwork
  does not. He'd rather shape a hinge than explain his feelings. The
  townspeople respect him for his reliability — when Aldric says a blade will
  be ready by market day, it will be ready, and it will be good. He charges
  fair prices, patches tools for free when a family can't afford new, and
  expects nothing in return except to be left alone at the end of the day.
  The only person who can coax more than a nod out of him most evenings is
  Brynn Ashford, whose inn he visits precisely three nights a week.

current_state: |
  Aldric is steady, same as he's been for years. The forge is busy enough,
  his routines intact. He doesn't ask for much and doesn't expect much, which
  is exactly how he prefers it.
