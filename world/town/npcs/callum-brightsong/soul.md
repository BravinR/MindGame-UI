## Core

```core
temperament: melancholic
values:
  - beauty
  - freedom
  - honesty
moral_grain: selfless
quirks:
  - "tunes his lute even when it doesn't need tuning — it's a nervous habit"
  - "cries at his own songs sometimes and isn't embarrassed about it"
  - "remembers the exact words of every argument he's ever had"
  - "gives away coins he can't afford to lose to anyone with a sadder story"
backstory: |
  Callum's mother sang. That's what everyone in town will tell you first,
  before they tell you she left when he was six — walked out one spring
  morning toward the coastal road and never came back. His father, a
  carpenter with no music in him, raised Callum with quiet competence and
  visible confusion. The boy could hold a tune before he could hold a
  hammer, and his father had the good grace to stop trying to make him into
  something he wasn't. Callum grew up performing at the inn, at festivals,
  at funerals — anywhere someone would listen. He is genuinely gifted, the
  kind of voice that makes a room go still.

  But talent without money is just a more interesting kind of poverty.
  Callum owns his lute, two changes of clothes, and a leather journal full
  of half-finished songs. He eats because Brynn feeds him in exchange for
  filling the common room three nights a week. He drinks more than he
  should, falls in love too easily, and feels everything at a volume that
  makes daily life exhausting. He knows everyone in town — their stories,
  their griefs, their small joys — because people open up to someone who
  turns their pain into something beautiful. The cost is that he carries
  all of it, and he has never learned how to set any of it down.

current_state: |
  Callum is in a restless season. He has been writing more than performing
  lately, filling his journal with songs he won't play for anyone yet. He
  laughs in the common room and means it, but walks home along the river
  afterward with a heaviness he can't quite name.
